                    Hello! I'm Gheorghii, a passionate Frontend Developer dedicated to creating seamless and engaging user experiences. With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular, I transform innovative ideas into interactive and responsive web applications.

                    I have worked on various projects, from simple landing pages to complex single-page applications. I focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code, ensuring every project is functional and visually appealing.
                    
                    I constantly learn new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of web development. Collaboration and communication are essential to my workflow, and I enjoy working with designers, back-end developers, and other stakeholders to bring projects to life.
                    
                    When not coding, I explore the latest web design trends or enjoy a good book.
                    
                    Check out my portfolio to see my projects. Contact me if you think I’d be a good match for your projects!
